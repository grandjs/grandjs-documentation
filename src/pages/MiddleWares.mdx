# MiddleWares
middleWares is a group of functions used to run something before executing the final handler

the middWares property should be an array includes the functions

Every middleware should have three parameters

| parameter  | type  | description  |
|---|---|---|
| req  | object  | implies the coming request object contains all information about the request  |
|res   | object  | represents the response object  |
| next  | function  | is a function you can execute it to continue to the next middleWare or to the final handler of the router  |

**Example**

```javascript
//middle ware
function writeWithMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    // has three parameters
    /*
    1- req: the request object
    2- res: the response object
    3- next: a function you execute it to continue to the handler
    */
   res.write("from middleware");
   next();
}
homePage() {
    return {
        url: "/home",
        middleWares: [],
        method: "get",
        handler: (req, res) => {
            res.end("hello home page");

            // final output on the browser:
            //from middleware
            //hello home page
        }
    }
}
```

**note**

that the middlWares array can include many middleWare functions and the middleWares are applied according to the indexing inside the array
