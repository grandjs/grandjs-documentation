# MiddleWares
middleWares are a group of functions used to run something before executing the final handler

## Concept

Grandjs Uses MiddleWares to enable the program to execute functions and some code before executing the final handler which enable you to edit the executed code without affecting the code base, basically middleware is a someway of applying aspect-oriented programming in nodejs

Grandjs applies middleWares on different levels as the following:

- Application level
- Router level
- Route level


## Implementation

Actually with grandjs you can define your middleWares in different ways

### Apply MiddleWares on Application level

you can apply grandjs middlewares on Application level by using `use` property

```typescript
import { Server, HttpStatusCode } from "grandjs";

Server.setConfig({
  port: 3000,
  nativeParsing: true,
  errorPage(req, res) {
    res.status(HttpStatusCode.NOT_FOUND).end("not found page");
},
})
// apply a middleWare
Server.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("this middleware will be applied on every route on the application")
})

Server.initServer(() => {
  console.log('server is initialized')
});
```

this middleWare will be executed when you request any url on the server

In this way you can use the any third party package that you use with express like body parser or cookie parser or any package that is can be consumed as a middleWare


### Apply MiddleWares on Router level

In this level, the middleWare will be applied on all the routes that are defined inside this router and also will be applied on all child routers, This type of middleWares in grandjs called global MiddleWares

Implementing MiddleWare on the router level can be applied using different ways

1. Using ``router.use`` method

```typescript
import { Router } from 'grandjs';

class MyRouter extends Router {}

const myRouter = new MyRouter({ base: '/' });
myRouter.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("apply this middleWare on all routes related to this router")
    return next();
});

```

2. Using ``this.use`` method

If you want to define your router middleWares inside your constructor you can use the a pattern like the following:

```typescript

class MyRouter extends Router {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.use((req, res, next) => {
            console.log("apply this middleWare on all routes related to this router")
            return next();
        })
    }
}

```

3. Using `MiddleWare` decorator

In this way, if you are familiar with typescript decorators you can use `@MiddleWare` decorator to define a router global middleWare

```typescript
import { Router, MiddleWare } from "grandjs";

class MyRouter extends Router {
    @MiddleWare
    applyOnAll(req, res, next) {
        console.log("apply this middleWare on all routes related to this router")
        return next();
    }
}
```
### Apply MiddleWares on Route level

In this level, the middleWare will be applied on the specified route only and this is called in grandjs as private middleWare

To define private middleWares for a specific route in grandjs you can use one of the following ways

- Push middleWares in an array

the middleWares property should be an array that includes the functions

Every middleware should have three parameters

| parameter  | type  | description  |
|---|---|---|
| req  | object  | implies the coming request object contains all information about the request  |
|res   | object  | represents the response object  |
| next  | function  | is a function you can execute it to continue to the next middleWare or to the final handler of the router  |

**Javascript Example**

```javascript
//middle ware
function writeWithMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    // has three parameters
    /*
    1- req: the request object
    2- res: the response object
    3- next: a function you execute it to continue to the handler
    */
   res.write("from middleware");
   next();
}
homePage() {
    return {
        url: "/home",
        middleWares: [],
        method: "get",
        handler: (req, res) => {
            res.end("hello home page");

            // final output on the browser:
            //from middleware
            //hello home page
        }
    }
}
```

**note**

that the middlWares array can include many middleWare functions and the middleWares are applied according to the indexing inside the array

**Typescript Example Using Decorator**

```typescript
import { Router, GET } from "grandjs";

class MyRouter extends Router {
    @GET({
        middleWares: [
            (req, res, next) => {
                console.log("apply this middleWare on url /dashboard get request");
                return next();
            }
        ],
        url: "/dashboard",
    })
    getDashboard(req, res) {
        return res.end("dashboard");
    }
}
```

- Using `@RouteMiddleWare` decorator

if you are familiar with typescript, you can use decorators to inject middleWare inside your router to be applied on a specific route

```typescript
import { Router, GET, RouteMiddleWare, RequestMethod } from "grandjs";

class MyRouter extends Router {
    @GET({
        url: "/dashboard",
    })
    getDashboard(req, res) {
        return res.end("dashboard");
    }

    @RouteMiddleWare({
        url: '/dashbaord',
        method: RequestMethod.GET
    })
    applyPrivateMiddleWare(req, res, next) {
        console.log("apply this middleWare on url /dashboard get request");
        return next();
    }
}
```

the ``RequestMethod`` decorator takes one parameter as an object as the following:

| property  | type  | description  |
|---|---|---|
| url  | string  | specify the route url you want to apply this middleWare on it, if this url is (``*``) then the middleWare will be applied on all routes that matches the request method  |
|method   | string  | the request method of routes that you want to apply the middleWare on them (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, ALL) all means all routes that match the url and has any request method  |
