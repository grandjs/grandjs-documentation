#### Request params
returns an object contains the parameters of the router URL and it's value if it exists
if there are no params so it returns an empty object

**Example**

```javascript
const homePage = new Router({
    baes: "/"
})
home.addRoute({
    url: "/posts/:category",
    method: "get",
    handler: (req, res) => {
        // user requested http://localhost:300/posts/tech?postId=2
        console.log(req.params); //output {category:"tech"};
        console.log(req.query) //output {postId: 2}
        console.log(req.pathname) //output /posts/tech
        console.log(req.path) //output /posts/tech?postId=2
        console.log(req.href) //output /posts/tech?postId=2
        console.log(req.method) //output "get"
        console.log(req.url)
        console.log(req.body);
        console.log(req.data);
        /* output
        Url {
        protocol: null,
        slashes: null,
        auth: null,
        host: null,
        port: null,
        hostname: null,
        hash: null,
        search: '?postId=2',
        query: 'postId=2',
        pathname: '/posts/tech',
        path: '/posts/tech?postId=2',
        href: '/posts/tech?postId=2' }
        */
    }
});
```

## Handle post request

Grandjs handles all types of post requests and submitted data and returns them as an object called ``req.data`` and another property `req.body` this object contains all the submitted data and you can access on it inside the handler function if the method of the router is post

**Example**

```javascript
postAdminPage() {
    return {
        method: "post",
        url: "/admin/addinfo",
        handler: (req, res) => {
            console.log(req.data || req.data) //output {} contains all submitted info
        }
    }
}
```


## Request Uploaded Files

In Grandjs You can upload files easily without any extra settings, all you should do is specifying Request header as `multipart/form-data`

Grandjs Uses multiparty package for file uploading

You can access on the uploaded files via `files` property in the request object as the following:

```javascript
postAdminPage() {
    return {
        method: "post",
        url: "/admin/uploadInfo",
        handler: (req, res) => {
            console.log(req.files) //output {} contains all uploaded files
        }
    }
}
```

`req.files` property is an object which includes the uploaded files as properties, each property incarnates the uploaded file as an object, but if there are multiple files uploaded with the same filed name so they will be grouped together inside the property name as an array of objects

each object has the following properties:

```javascript
{
      name: 'images' // the name of the filed,
      filename: 'download (1).jpeg' // original file name,
      data: <Buffer> // the file content as buffer,
      size: 14473 // size of file,
      extension: '.jpg' // the extension type of file,
      mimetype: 'image/jpeg' // mime type of file,
      stream: [Duplex] // ability to use this file to stream it,
       headers: [Object] // the sent headers with this file,
      byteOffset: 147,
      byteCount: 27975 // bytes count

```
**Note**

For Request Body parsing you have two options

- use native Grandjs request parser which will also parse request with formdata

- use `body-parser` package for parsing json requests and use `express-fileupload` for parsing `multipart/form-data` request body
